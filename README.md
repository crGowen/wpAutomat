 Automation tool for finding wallpapers from Reddit subreddits
 
 This tool requires that you have a recent version of PHP installed with the built-in PHP test server (comes installed with most PHP distributions).
 
 To run simply navigate to the folder and double-click on the start.bat script, it will then guide you through the rest of the way.
